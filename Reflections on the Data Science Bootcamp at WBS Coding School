Starting the Data Science Bootcamp with WBS Coding School was an eye-opening experience. Without prior knowledge of bootcamps, I started this journey with a single intention: to learn and grow. Here’s an overview of what I’ve learned and achieved so far:

Practicing the Primer: The Primer provided by WBS Coding School offered an excellent introduction to key tools and concepts:
SQL: I encountered SQL for the first time and completed all exercises, which were highly informative and effective for building a foundational understanding.

Tableau: This was my initial exposure to Tableau, and it became clear that mastering it would be a valuable and ongoing endeavor.

Python: Despite having prior experience with Python, the Primer presented exciting and engaging challenges that deepened my understanding of the language.

Advancing SQL and Tableau Skills in Class:
The first project of the bootcamp provided an opportunity to expand my knowledge of SQL and Tableau further. Through hands-on exercises, I applied these skills to analyze and present solutions to a fictional business scenario.

Project: ENIAC-MAGIST Analysis
For this project, we analyzed a fictional case set in 2018 involving ENIAC, an online marketplace specializing in Apple-compatible accessories, and MAGIST, a company offering logistics and customer support services.

 ENIAC wanted to expand its services to the Brazilian market.

 MAGIST offered stock and warehouse management, product shipment, and customer service.

 The objective was to evaluate whether MAGIST would be a suitable partner for ENIAC's high-end tech products.

Executed SQL queries to analyze the dataset and derive insights in MySQL Workbench.
Created detailed graphs and visualizations based on the SQL results in Tableau.
Designed a compelling presentation to showcase the findings and recommendations in Canva.
